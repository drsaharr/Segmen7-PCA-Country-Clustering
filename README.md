# Segmen7-PCA-Country-Clustering
This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms to group countries based on key socio-economic and health indicators.

The main objective is to identify clusters of countries with similar development profiles to better target financial aid, policy interventions, and global resource allocation.
